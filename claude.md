# Claude Code Guidelines

## Commit Messages

- Keep commit messages simple and to the point
- No emojis
- No Claude/AI attribution or branding
- Describe what changed, not how it was made
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add resize functionality" not "Added resize functionality")

Example good commits:
- "Add resize handles to select tool"
- "Fix box rendering at canvas edge"
- "Implement wire tool with net labels"

Example bad commits:
- "🎉 Add awesome new feature!"
- "Generated with Claude Code"
- "AI-assisted implementation of..."
